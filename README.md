# Warehouse Management Simulation

A Java-based warehouse management system simulation that demonstrates the interaction between suppliers and consumers using multithreading and semaphores. The graphical user interface provides real-time updates on inventory levels and transaction history.

## Features

- **Concurrent Operations**: Simulates multiple threads for suppliers and consumers.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays the current inventory and transaction history in a user-friendly interface.
- **Time Simulation**: Models working hours and simulates time progression for consumer purchases.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)
- Semaphores (for thread synchronization)

## Usage

The simulation will start with a graphical window showing the current stock and customer status.
Suppliers will continuously add items to the warehouse.
Consumers will attempt to purchase items during working hours (9 AM to 6 PM).
The system will display transaction history in real-time.
